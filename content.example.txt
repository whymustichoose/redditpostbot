Example Post Title

This is an example of how to structure your content file. The first line should be the subreddit name where you want to post.

The second line is your post title.

All lines after that will be the body of your post. You can include:

- Regular text
- **Bold text** using double asterisks
- *Italic text* using single asterisks
- Lists using dashes or numbers
- Links using [text](url) format

You can also include tables using markdown:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Data 3   | Data 4   |

Remember to:
1. Keep the subreddit name on the first line
2. Keep the title on the second line
3. Put all content after that
4. Save the file with a .txt extension
5. Place it in the content directory
